## Overview

In general, many homeowners keep plants in their own house, whether it's to bring more life to the house, increase air quality, etc. These plants require the homeowner to care for them  by watering them on a regular basis. 

The issue is that a lot of people are too busy to water their plants sometimes. This can happen when homeowners go on business trips, vacations, or other reasons.

For our final project, we are designing a robot to automatically water plants over a duration of time while the owner is unable to  take care of their plants.

The repo will contain our code for the robot, logs of our changes, and more.
